PointerPlay in C++
==================
When I first learned C++ I had the hardest time with pointers. As I start re-learning the language I wanted to get a handle on what things would do in certain situations. It helped me visualize how pointers and parameters interact.

This is a console app that displays the values of the variables in their current state as they are modified.

Hope it's helpful to anyone just coming to the language.
